# Sheet Music Reader

#### This is an application made for my A-Level Computer Science project

The purpose of this program is to give musicians a simple way to view scanned sheet music files, without needing to use a clunky, standard image viewer.

The program features:
- A basic image viewer
- A zoom function
- Side by side and vertical image viewing
- Printing with support for multiple pages
- Recent file selection
- Editable background colour
- Startup screen with recent file selection and quick preview of each recent file
